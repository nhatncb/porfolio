The performance is situated in a multilateral experimentation in psychology and existence of the self in absolute reality and layered space.

    Phase 1: As much as possible
    The small dots seem tender, silently and aggressively multiply to occupy mind and time, satisfying oneself to the point of exhaustion. Entering “Nothingness” allows ourselves to enter a ritual of mental inquisition, where possessiveness is confronted, interpreted, and interacted with through a series of actions incrementally led by our subconsciousness. Next to physical remnants and memories, there are remnants of the digital age, where every action is not only recorded but can be readily copied, multiplied, and shared, awaiting to resurge at a time when we usually cannot control but maybe, only accept.
    
    Phase 2: I no longer need this
    Then to transform later into a meaningless and frustrating dark battlefield, forcing us to find ways to eradicate it, because how else can we have space – opportunity to be refilled by other things?
    
    Phase 3: See you again
    Because of that, will – the blurred stains on the paper, the indents, scraps from the erasure, and the marks of exchange be necessary? to eradicate – to deny.`,
